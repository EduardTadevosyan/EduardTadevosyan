### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Eduard, an aspiring data analyst who requalified into data after several years in administrative roles.  
I learned data analytics as a **hobby in my spare time**, diving deep into Python, SQL, and BI tools because I loved it — now it's my career path!  
I enjoy finding patterns, solving problems, and building clean, insightful dashboards and models.
